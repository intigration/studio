**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) |** The process of investigating, organizing, and analyzing datasets and summarizing their main characteristics, often employing data wrangling and visualization methods.

**Practices of EDA:**
- **Discovering |** process of data familiarization in order to conceptualize how the data can be used
- **Structuring |** the process of taking raw data and organizing or transforming it to be more easily visualized, explained, or modeled 
- **Cleaning |** the process of removing errors that may distort your data or make it less useful
- **Joining |** the process of augmenting or adjusting data by adding values from other datasets
- **Validating |** the process of verifying that the data is consistent and high quality
- **Presenting |** making the cleaned dataset or data visualizations available to others for analysis or further modeling
